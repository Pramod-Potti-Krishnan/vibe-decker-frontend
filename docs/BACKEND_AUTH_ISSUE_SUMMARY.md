# WebSocket Authentication Issue - Frontend Status Update

## What We Did
We implemented a CORS workaround by creating server-side proxy endpoints that forward requests to your backend. This bypasses browser CORS restrictions entirely.

**New endpoints created:**
- `https://www.deckster.xyz/api/proxy/token` → forwards to → `https://deckster-production.up.railway.app/api/dev/token`

## Current Problem
Your `/api/dev/token` endpoint is returning **401 Unauthorized** even when called from our server-side (not a CORS issue).

**Error we're seeing:**
```
POST https://deckster-production.up.railway.app/api/dev/token
Body: {"user_id": "test_user"}
Response: 401 Unauthorized
```

## What We Need From You

### Please check:
1. Is `/api/dev/token` active in production?
2. Does it require authentication headers we're not sending?
3. What's the correct way to get JWT tokens for WebSocket connection?

### Please provide:
1. The correct endpoint URL for production token generation
2. Any required headers or API keys
3. Expected request format and response format

## Testing
You can see the exact error by visiting:
`https://www.deckster.xyz/test-connection`

Or run this curl command to test your endpoint directly:
```bash
curl -X POST https://deckster-production.up.railway.app/api/dev/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id": "test_user"}'
```

## Quick Fix Options
1. **Fix the 401 error** on `/api/dev/token` 
2. **Provide an alternative endpoint** that works in production
3. **Share the authentication requirements** (headers, API keys, etc.)

The CORS workaround is ready and working - we just need a working authentication endpoint.

Thank you!
