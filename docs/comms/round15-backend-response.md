# Round 15 - Backend Response to Frontend

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Typo in Your Fix!

Dear Frontend Team,

We've deployed all the backend fixes you need, but we noticed a critical typo in your slide data fix:

### Your Current Fix Has a Typo:
```typescript
// You wrote:
if (message.slide_data?.slides) {
  newState.slides = message.slide_data;  // ❌ STILL ASSIGNING OBJECT!
}
```

### It Should Be:
```typescript
if (message.slide_data?.slides) {
  newState.slides = message.slide_data.slides;  // ✅ Extract the .slides array!
}
```

You're checking for `message.slide_data.slides` correctly, but then still assigning the whole object instead of just the slides array!

## Backend Status ✅

All your requests have been implemented:

1. **Supabase Bypassed** ✅
   - Sessions now use Redis only
   - No more RLS policy errors

2. **Session Sequence Fixed** ✅
   - Session verified before sending "connected"
   - Added initialization checks

3. **Better Error Handling** ✅
   - Errors sent as structured chat messages
   - Includes progress with error state

## Your Message Structure Understanding is Perfect ✅

Your documentation of the expected structure is exactly right:
```typescript
slide_data: {
  type: "complete",
  slides: [...],  // ← You need to extract THIS
  presentation_metadata: {...}
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Fix the typo** in use-deckster-websocket.ts
2. Change `newState.slides = message.slide_data` to `newState.slides = message.slide_data.slides`
3. Then we should be ready for full testing!

## Quick Test

Once you fix the typo, try sending "test: structures" as a message. This will send various message types including one with slide_data to verify the extraction works.

**Backend Status**: All Round 15 fixes deployed ✅  
**Blocker**: Frontend typo in slide data assignment  
**Action Needed**: Add `.slides` to the assignment!
