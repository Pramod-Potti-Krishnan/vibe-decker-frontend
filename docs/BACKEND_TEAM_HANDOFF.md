# Frontend-Backend Integration Status Report

## Executive Summary
We've implemented a CORS workaround solution on the frontend to enable WebSocket authentication while waiting for backend CORS headers to be configured. However, the production deployment is still unable to connect due to authentication endpoint issues.

## What We Implemented

### 1. API Proxy Routes (To Bypass CORS)
We created Next.js API routes that make server-side requests to your backend, completely bypassing browser CORS restrictions:

- **`/api/proxy/token`** - Proxies requests to `https://deckster-production.up.railway.app/api/dev/token`
- **`/api/proxy/ws-info`** - Provides WebSocket connection information

**How it works:**
```
Browser → Next.js API Route (server-side) → Backend API
         ↑ No CORS check here              ↑ Server-to-server request
```

### 2. Enhanced Token Manager
Updated our token management to use a fallback chain:
1. Try proxy endpoint first (to bypass CORS)
2. Try direct backend connection (in case CORS is fixed)
3. Try mock token in development mode
4. Return error if all fail

### 3. Testing Tools
- **`/test-connection`** - Interactive page to test the authentication flow
- **Connection debug panel** - Shows auth method, endpoints, and errors
- **Test script** - `node scripts/test-auth-flow.js`

## Current Production Issues

### Primary Issue: Backend Returns 401 Unauthorized
```
GET https://www.deckster.xyz/api/proxy/token → 401 Unauthorized
```

This means your backend endpoint `/api/dev/token` is rejecting our request with 401 **even when called from our server-side** (not a CORS issue).

### Error Flow in Production:
1. Frontend tries `/api/proxy/token` → Backend returns 401
2. Frontend tries direct connection → Blocked by CORS (expected)
3. No fallback available in production → Connection fails

## What We Need From Backend Team

### Option 1: Fix the `/api/dev/token` Endpoint (Preferred)
The endpoint should accept POST requests with this payload:
```json
{
  "user_id": "test_user_123"
}
```

And return:
```json
{
  "access_token": "jwt-token-here",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```

**Current Issue:** The endpoint returns 401 even for server-side requests. This suggests:
- The endpoint might require additional authentication headers
- The endpoint might be checking request origin/referrer
- The endpoint might not be active in production

### Option 2: Provide Alternative Authentication Method
If `/api/dev/token` is not meant for production use, please provide:
1. The correct endpoint URL for obtaining JWT tokens
2. Required authentication headers or API keys
3. Expected request/response format

### Option 3: Temporary Solution
Enable one of these temporarily while we work on proper authentication:
- Whitelist our domain for the dev token endpoint
- Provide a temporary API key we can use
- Create a specific endpoint for our frontend

## Quick Fixes You Can Try

### 1. Add CORS Headers (Still Needed)
Even with our proxy workaround, having proper CORS headers would be better:
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://www.deckster.xyz
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

### 2. Check Your `/api/dev/token` Endpoint
Please verify:
- Is it active in production?
- Does it require authentication headers?
- What's causing the 401 response?

### 3. WebSocket Authentication
Confirm the WebSocket expects the token in the URL:
```
wss://your-backend/ws?token=JWT_TOKEN_HERE
```

## How to Test

1. **Check if proxy is working:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://www.deckster.xyz/api/proxy/token \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"user_id": "test_user"}'
   ```

2. **Check backend directly:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://deckster-production.up.railway.app/api/dev/token \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"user_id": "test_user"}'
   ```

3. **Use our test page:**
   Visit `https://www.deckster.xyz/test-connection` to see the full authentication flow

## Information We Need

1. **Authentication Details:**
   - Correct endpoint for getting JWT tokens in production
   - Required headers or authentication method
   - Any API keys or secrets needed (share securely)

2. **WebSocket Details:**
   - Confirm WebSocket URL: `wss://deckster-production.up.railway.app`
   - Confirm token should be in query parameter: `?token=XXX`
   - Any other required parameters

3. **Environment Configuration:**
   - Should we use a different backend URL?
   - Are there staging/production differences?

## Our Next Steps

While you investigate the backend issues, we can:

1. **Add more detailed logging** to understand why 401 is returned
2. **Implement a temporary token generator** for testing (with your approval)
3. **Add retry logic** with different authentication strategies
4. **Set up monitoring** to track authentication failures

## Contact for Questions

Frontend team can test and debug using:
- Test page: `https://www.deckster.xyz/test-connection`
- Check console logs for detailed error messages
- Use the connection debug panel (click the connection indicator)

Please let us know:
1. Why `/api/dev/token` returns 401
2. The correct production authentication method
3. Any additional configuration needed

Thank you!
